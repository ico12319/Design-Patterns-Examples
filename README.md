Here, you'll find simple and clear implementations of various design patterns in C++. 
Whether you're new to design patterns or just looking for some practical examples, this repo aims to help you understand and apply these concepts in your own projects.
Included Design Patterns(for now): 
1. Visitor pattern: The Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them. It's great for when you need to perform different actions on a group of related objects.
2. Composite pattern(Tree structure): The Composite pattern allows you to build tree structures of objects. This helps you work with these objects uniformly, whether you're dealing with a single object or a whole tree.
3. Singleton: The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. Use this when you need a single point of control for a particular resource.
